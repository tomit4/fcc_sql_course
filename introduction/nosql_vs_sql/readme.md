## NoSQL Vs SQL

When talking about SQL databases, we also have to mention the elephant in the
room: [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NoSQL).

To put it simply, a NoSQL database is a database that does <em>not</em> use SQL
(Structured Query Language). Each NoSQL typically has it's own way of writing
and executing queries. For example, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) uses
MQL(MongoDB Query Language) and [ElastiSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) simply has a JSON API.

While most relational databases are fairly similar, NoSQL databases tend to be
fairly unique and are used for more niche purposes. Some of the main differences
between a SQL and NoSQL databases are:

1. NoSQL databases are usually non-relational, SQL databases are usually
   [relational](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relational_database)
   (we'll talk more about what this means later).

2. SQL databases usually have a defined schema, NoSQL databases usually have a
   dynamic schema.

3. SQL databases are table-based, NoSQL databases have a variety of different
   storage methods, such as document, key-value, graph, wide-column, and more.

### Types of NoSQL Databases

- [Document Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Document-oriented_database)
- [Key-Value Store](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Key%E2%80%93value_database)
- [Wide-Column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-column_store)
- [Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database)

A few of the most popular NoSQL databases are:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html)
- [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/)
- [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)
