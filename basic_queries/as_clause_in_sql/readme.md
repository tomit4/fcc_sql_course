## As Clause In SQL

Sometimes we need to structure the data we return from our queries in a specific
way. An `AS` clause allwos us to "alias" a piece of data in our query. The
alias only exists for the duration of the query.

### As Keyword

The following queries return the same data:

```sql
SELECT employee_id AS id, employee_name AS name FROM employees;
```

```sql
SELECT employee_id , employee_name FROM employees;
```

The difference is that the results displayed from the aliased query would have
column names `id` and `name` instead of `employee_id` and `employee_name`.

### Assignment

A user has asked us to find all transactions on their account from their gradma.
We thought it would be fun to rename the `note` field to `birthday_message`
because we noticed all the transactions from grandma are birthday messages.

Return the `amount` and the `note` field (renamed to `birthday_message`) from
the `transactions` table where the `sender_id` is `10` (grandma).

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT amount, note AS birthday_message FROM transactions WHERE sender_id=10;
```
